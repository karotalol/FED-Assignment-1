# FED-Assignment-1
The website that I created is to promote a gym, FitLife Studio. It is a modern fitness website where it is designed to attract and inspire individuals to transform their lives through health and fitness. This website makes it such that it allows users to access essential information that this gym has to offer. This includes programs, memberships, and success stories. The goal is to motivate and inspire more people to take their first step towards a healthier lifestyle.

The design process for FitLife Studio was centered around understanding the needs of potential customers. This website mainly targets potential individuals that are looking for a gym to join. The darker background is to allow customers to enjoy the visuals better since majority of people prefer dark mode currently. A slight combination of color is also included to reflect a more cooler and motivating vibe for a gym.

Testing Scenarios:
I kept on going back and forth from the visual studio code to the main website to check for any errors. Using inspect element to check for the mobile views as well.
